We can create named areas on the grid to put content into. To do this we first assign elements in our markup to a Grid Area, using the grid-area property.

We can then use the grid-template-areas property to describe where on the Grid these elements should sit.

Repeating the name of an area indicates that the area spans that grid track. Using a . or a sequence like .... indicates an empty track. Such as the very first cell on this grid.

```js
var a = 10;
function a(a){
    add something here
}

hey
